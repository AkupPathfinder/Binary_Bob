# Binary_Bob
1. This projekt was my first program which was created on C. It was created during the course of programming in my University. 
2. I and my comrade agreed that we should publish this project to help the others who will study this course. We want to publish this project because during the
development we were looking for the references for our programm and all the references were written in C++ while our projekt is written in C.
